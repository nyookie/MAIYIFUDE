## Background 
With the development of technology and the Internet, online shopping has become a norm in our life. Most of us shop for essentials through an online shopping system , exemplifying Shopee, Lazada, Shein and so on. Although online shopping has brought convenience to our life that we can shop without leaving our house, we cannot guarantee that the products are the same as described, especially clothing stuff that we cannot feel the texture, the quality and the size of the clothes. We might face the issues of undesired materials or wrong sizes of clothes upon receiving. Therefore, our team has decided to create an online platform to sell pre-loved clothes to those in need or in favor at a lower price. This system will put the pre-loved clothes on the shelf for others to take home. This is a win-win situation where the pre-loved clothes will be taken by someone who needs it at a lower price than the first hand price. The seller can get some money back and not waste the clothes by putting it in the closet forever.
In light of the 13th Sustainable Development Goals - Climate Action, the project is undertaken in hope to bring awareness of the environmental concerns that arise from fast fashion which contributed to fashion and greenhouse gas emission. According to FORBES by James Conca, the apparel industry accounts for 10% of global carbon emission, generating a lot of greenhouse gasses due to the energy used during its production, manufacturing, and transportation of the garments purchased each year. When low quality garments break down, they do not usually break down completely; instead they disintegrate into microfibers which are eventually released into the water then the ocean, in a bigger picture, affecting aquatic lives.
Hence, this project takes the opportunity to bring second income to families by selling their pre-loved, provide a trustworthy and affordable platform to shop and to reduce environmental impacts that the fashion industry brought.

## Objectives
* To reduce environmental impacts and waste resources for clothes production.
* To apply knowledge and skills that learned from Web Programming lectures.
* To provide eco-friendly clothes with affordable prices to people.

## Scope 
[What will be the end result of the project? Describe here what phases of work will be undertaken.]
A comprehensive clothes selling system will be produced, which includes relevant interfaces such as customer, seller and product information. The stakeholders in the case study such as customers and sellers should be able to realize their respective functions. To name a few, upload clothes for selling and purchase clothes.  In this project, there will be three phases of work to be undertaken. First and foremost,  planning activity will be conducted to prepare an initial proposal for outlining the case study. It will include various parts such as background, objectives, scope and time frame. When it comes to phase two, design and implementation activities on the client and server sides will be performed on a free web hosting server. Lastly, testing and debugging will be done accordingly in order to produce a functional and practical system.
